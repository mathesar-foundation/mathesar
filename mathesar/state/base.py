    Resets our reflection of what's on Postgres databases. Reset meaning that information is

    We have following forms of state (aka reflection), and all are reset by this routine:
        - Django cache (django.core.cache),
        - Django models (mathesar.models namespace),
        - SQLAlchemy MetaData.

    Note, this causes immediate calls to Postgres.
