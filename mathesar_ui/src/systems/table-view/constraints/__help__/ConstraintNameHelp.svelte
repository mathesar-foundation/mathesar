  <p>
    At the database level, each constraint must have a unique name across all
    the constraints, tables, views, and indexes within the schema.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Mathesar however, the name of the constraint will likely never be
    relevant, &mdash; so we recommend allowing Mathesar to automatically
    generate constraint names when adding new constraints.
