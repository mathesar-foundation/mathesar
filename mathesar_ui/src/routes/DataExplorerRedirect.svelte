<!--
@component

This component exists to redirect a path like

`/db/1/schemas/123/explorations/1/edit`

to

`/db/1/schemas/123/explorations/1`

This redirect is necessary because previously we had two routes for an
exploration â€” one with the `/edit` segment appended and one without it. When we
consolidated those routes, we wanted to avoid broken user bookmarks.

I'm not sure if there's a better way to do this redirect. I tried using tinro's
[redirect property][1] but I couldn't get it to work with this use case.
