<!--
  @component

  Use this component when you want to accept user input for a number that might
  have too much precision to be accurately represented by a javascript `number`
  or `bigint`.

  For example, the number `99999999999999.99` can't be stored as a `bigint`
  because it's not an integer, and it can't be stored as a `number` because it
  be rounded to the nearest 64-bit floating point value of `99999999999999.98`.
  This component gracefully handles such numbers by always yielding a `value` of
  type `string` which is canonically formatted as numbers appear in JSON.

  ## Features

  - Invalid input is rejected.

  - Input is partially formatted as the user types. Grouping separators are
    automatically inserted (although only for input that can accurately be
    represented by a `number` type).

  - Input is fully reformatted when focus is blurred. For example, trailing
    decimal separators are removed.

  ## Limitations

  - You don't get a numerical value, so you can't reliably perform client-side
    numerical operations on the user input. See `NumberInput.svelte` for a
    component that will bind to a `number` instead of a `string`.
