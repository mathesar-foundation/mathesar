/**
 * AccompanyingElements stores references to any DOM nodes which "accompany" a
 * Dropdown -- even when those nodes are not nested within the Dropdown's
 * content. We store these references so that we're able to keep the Dropdown
 * open when the user clicks on an accompanying element. The use case is
 * primarily (but not necessarily limited to) nested Dropdown components.
 *
 * Since Dropdown components can be nested to an arbitrary degree, we also
 * store a reference to the AccompanyingElements object for the parent
 * Dropdown component (if applicable). This allows us to forward changes up to
 * the parent so that deeply nested Dropdown components can inform all their
 * ancestors of their content.
 *
 * Why is this class Readable instead of Writable? Because we need to forward
 * specific _changes_, up to the parent AccompanyingElements object. The `add`
 * and `delete` methods allow us to do that, but a `set` method would not
 * because it wouldn't be clear whether we're adding or removing or both.
