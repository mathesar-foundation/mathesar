# Vendored code

## tinro

We vendored this package in 2025-08 because it has gone unmaintained

Source repo: https://github.com/AlexxNB/tinro

We started by importing the code from commit 5e68ccc7015ab6f0aefe40519d5262fa27690e36 within the upstream repo.

Since then, we've applied the following additional changes

1. We ported this [PR](https://github.com/AlexxNB/tinro/pull/121) which fixes a TS error on the `<Route>` component.
