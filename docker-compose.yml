#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# INFO ABOUT VOLUMES
#
# Volumes are used by Mathesar to persist essential data.
#
# Running this compose file will automatically create a subdirectory named
# "msar" with the following file structure:
# 
# msar
# ├── caddy/  (stores certificates, keys, and other information for Caddy)
# ├── media/  (stores user uploaded datafiles(.csv/.tsv) to Mathesar)
# ├── pgdata/ (stores PostgreSQL data)
# └── static/ (stores static files for Mathesar)

# MATHESAR SERVICES
#
# The next section defines various containers in a workable production setup.
#
services:
  #-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Mathesar web service
  #
  # This service provides the main web server required to run Mathesar, using
  # our official Docker image hosted on Docker Hub
  #
  # As configured, this service exposes port 8000 to other services but not the
  # host system. This isolates it from being directly accessed  by the host
  # while allowing access via caddy.
  #
  service:
    container_name: mathesar_service
    image: mathesar/mathesar-testing:latest
    environment: 
      # First we load the variables configured above.
      <<: *config

      DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE: config.settings.production

      # We set ALLOWED_HOSTS to * (allow all hosts) by default here since we are
      # relying on caddy to manage which domains could access the mathesar web
      # service.  If you do not want to use caddy add the domain(s) that you
      # want to ALLOWED_HOSTS. Doing so will restrict traffic from all other
      # domains.
      ALLOWED_HOSTS: ${ALLOWED_HOSTS:-*}

      # WARNING: MATHESAR_DATABASES is deprecated, and will be removed in a future release.
      MATHESAR_DATABASES: ${MATHESAR_DATABASES:-}

    healthcheck:
      test: curl -f http://localhost:8000
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 30
      start_period: 5s
    # If using caddy, expose the internal port 8000 only to other containers and

    # Uncomment the following if not using caddy
    # ports:
    #   - ${HOST_PORT:-8000}:8000

  #-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # PostgreSQL Database
  #
  # This service provides a Postgres database instance for holding both internal
  # Mathesar data, as well as user data if desired, using the official
  # PostgreSQL image hosted on Docker Hub
  #
  # As configured, this service exposes Postgres' default port (5432) to other
  # services, allowing the Mathesar web sevice to connect to it.
  #
  db:
    image: postgres:13
    container_name: mathesar_db
    # This service needs the config variables defined above.
    environment: *config
    # Expose the internal port 5432 only to other containers and not 
    # the underlying host.
    expose:
      - "5432"
    volumes:
      - ./msar/pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    healthcheck:
      test: [ "CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -d $${POSTGRES_DB} -U $${POSTGRES_USER}"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 1s
      retries: 30
      start_period: 5s

  #-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Caddy
  #
  # This service provides a reverse proxy for the Mathesar web server, using our
  # custom Caddy image hosted on Docker Hub. That image is customized to use a
  # Caddyfile with an appropriate configuration for Mathesar.
  #
  # Specifically, this service routes the requests to backend and the web
  # frontend of Mathesar while also serving essential staic files and user
  # uploaded datafiles(.csv/.tsv). It also provides SSL certificates
  # automatically for any custom domain(s) listed in DOMAIN_NAME that you might
  # want to use to access Mathesar.
  #
  # This service maps the default port for http(80) and https(443) of the host
  # system to that of docker's for allowing access to Mathesar over http or
  # https.
  #
  caddy-reverse-proxy:
    image: mathesar/mathesar-caddy:latest
    # This service needs the config variables defined above.
    environment: *config
    ports:
      - "80:80"
