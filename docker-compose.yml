# This file defines a viable production setup for Mathesar.
#
# It can be used in production directly, or used as an example to help define
# your own infrastructure.
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PREREQUISITES
#
# Please double-check that your docker setup meets the following criteria:
#
# OS: Linux, Mac, Windows(WSL).
# Docker v23+  $ docker version
# Docker Compose v2.10+  $ docker compose version
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# HOW TO USE THIS FILE
#
# First, make sure you meet the prerequisites, and then run:
#
# $ docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up
#
# Note: You may need to run Docker commands using sudo, depending on your setup.
# Running Docker in rootless mode isn't currently supported.
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CONFIG
#
# Customize your Mathesar installation with the following variables.
# See https://docs.mathesar.org/configuration/env-variables/ for more info.
#
x-config: &config
  # (Optional) Replace 'http://localhost' with custom domain(s) e.g.
  # 'yourdomain.com, 127.0.0.1' to manage the host(s) at which you want to
  # access Mathesar over http or https
  DOMAIN_NAME: ${DOMAIN_NAME:-http://localhost}

  # Edit the POSTGRES_* variables if you are not using the db service provided
  # below, or if you want to use a custom database user.

  # (Optional) Replace 'mathesar_django' with any custom name for the internal
  # database managed by mathesar web-service
  POSTGRES_DB: ${POSTGRES_DB:-mathesar_django}

  # (Optional) Replace 'mathesar' with any custom username for the
  # aforementioned database
  POSTGRES_USER: ${POSTGRES_USER:-mathesar}

  # (Optional) Replace 'mathesar' with any custom password for the
  # aforementioned database
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-mathesar}

  # (Optional) Replace 'mathesar_db' with the name of the host running postgres
  POSTGRES_HOST: ${POSTGRES_HOST:-mathesar_db}

  # (Optional) Replace '5432' with the port on which postgres is running
  POSTGRES_PORT: ${POSTGRES_PORT:-5432}

  # (Optional) Can be used to configure single-sign on (sso) instead of an
  # sso.yml configuration file.
  # See https://docs.mathesar.org/administration/single-sign-on/ for additional
  # details on how to configure this variable.

# ADDITIONAL INFO ABOUT CONFIG VARIABLES
#
# DOMAIN_NAME:
#     Default: http://localhost
#     Info: Specifies the domains that can access Mathesar over http(port 80)
#           or https(port 443), also automatically creating SSL certificates
#           for the same. If you want to host an instance of Mathesar over the
#           internet or over your local network, add those domains here.
#     Example: yourdomain.com, *.subdomain.com, 127.0.0.1
#
# POSTGRES_DB:
#     Default: mathesar_django
#     Info: Specifies a name for the database that will be created and used by
#           Mathesar for managing internal data.
#     Example: zeus
#
# POSTGRES_USER:
#     Default: mathesar
#     Info: Specifies creation of a user with superuser privileges
#           and a database with the same name.
#     Example: athena
#
# POSTGRES_PASSWORD:
#     Default: mathesar
#     Info: Specifies the superuser password that is required to be set for the

#     Example: apollo
#
# POSTGRES_HOST:
#     Default: mathesar_db (name of the db service provided below)
#     Info: Specifies the host name on which portgres listen for connections
#           from client applications. Can be a docker compose service name,
#           a A TCP host address (e.g., host.docker.internal), or a Unix
#           socket path (e.g., /var/run/postgresql).
#     Example: kratos
#
# POSTGRES_PORT:
#     Default: 5432

#           client applications.
#     Example: 5555
#
# OIDC_CONFIG_DICT:
#   Default: {}
#   Info: Specifies the settings necessary to configure Single Sign-on (SS0)
#   identity providers for Mathesar login. This is an optional, alternative
#   approach to configuring SSO via a configuration file.
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# INFO ABOUT VOLUMES
#
# Volumes are used by Mathesar to persist essential data.
#
# Running this compose file will automatically create a subdirectory named
# "msar" with the following file structure:
#
# msar
# ├── caddy/  (stores certificates, keys, and other information for Caddy)
# ├── media/  (stores user uploaded datafiles(.csv/.tsv) to Mathesar)
# ├── pgdata/ (stores PostgreSQL data)
# ├── secrets/ (stores the SECRET_KEY, eventually other secret info)
# └── static/ (stores static files for Mathesar)

# MATHESAR SERVICES
#
# The next section defines various containers in a workable production setup.
#
services:
  #-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Mathesar web service
  #
  # This service provides the main web server required to run Mathesar, using
  # our official Docker image hosted on Docker Hub
  #
  # As configured, this service exposes port 8000 to other services but not the
  # host system. This isolates it from being directly accessed  by the host
  # while allowing access via caddy.
  #
  service:
    container_name: mathesar_service
    image: mathesar/mathesar:latest
    environment:
      # First we load the variables configured above.
      <<: *config

      DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE: config.settings.production

      # We set ALLOWED_HOSTS to * (allow all hosts) by default here since we are
      # relying on caddy to manage which domains could access the mathesar web
      # service.  If you do not want to use caddy add the domain(s) that you
      # want to ALLOWED_HOSTS. Doing so will restrict traffic from all other
      # domains.
      ALLOWED_HOSTS: ${ALLOWED_HOSTS:-*}

      # SECURITY WARNING: don't run with DEBUG=true in production!
      DEBUG: ${DEBUG:-false}

      # To use a custom secret key, use an .env file, or add a sufficiently
      # random 50 character string after '-'. Otherwise a random value will be
      # generated when you start Mathesar. If you aren't sure, it's safe to
      # leave this as-is.
      SECRET_KEY: ${SECRET_KEY-}

      # If you are running Mathesar on a particularly powerful machine, you can
      # improve performance by increasing this setting. Replace '5' below with
      # 2 * $(NUM_CORES) + 1. So if you have a VPS with 4 vCPUs you can use a
      # value of 2 * 4 + 1, or 9. The default is workable as long as you have at
      # least 1 logical core.
      WEB_CONCURRENCY: ${WEB_CONCURRENCY-3}

    # ports:
    #   - ${HOST_PORT:-8000}:8000

  #-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # PostgreSQL Database
  #
  # This service provides a Postgres database instance for holding both internal
  # Mathesar data, as well as user data if desired, using the official
  # PostgreSQL image hosted on Docker Hub
  #
  # As configured, this service exposes Postgres' default port (5432) to other
  # services, allowing the Mathesar web sevice to connect to it.
  #
  db:
    image: pgautoupgrade/pgautoupgrade:17-bookworm
    container_name: mathesar_db
    # This service needs the config variables defined above.
    environment: *config
    # Expose the internal port 5432 only to other containers and not
    # the underlying host.
    # expose:
    #   - "5432"
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - ./msar/pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  #-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Caddy
  #
  # This service provides a reverse proxy for the Mathesar web server, using our
  # custom Caddy image hosted on Docker Hub. That image is customized to use a
  # Caddyfile with an appropriate configuration for Mathesar.
  #
  # Specifically, this service routes the requests to backend and the web
  # frontend of Mathesar while also serving essential staic files and user
  # uploaded datafiles(.csv/.tsv). It also provides SSL certificates
  # automatically for any custom domain(s) listed in DOMAIN_NAME that you might
  # want to use to access Mathesar.
  #
  # This service maps the default port for http(80) and https(443) of the host
  # system to that of docker's for allowing access to Mathesar over http or
  # https.
  #
  caddy-reverse-proxy:
    image: mathesar/mathesar-caddy:latest
    # This service needs the config variables defined above.
    environment: *config
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
