Our web-based interface helps you and your collaborators set up data models, edit data, and build custom reports \u2014 no technical skills needed. You can create a new PostgreSQL database while setting up Mathesar or use our UI to interact with an existing database (or do both). Try Mathesar \u00b6 This is a quick way to play with Mathesar locally, but is not appropriate for saving data that you care about or setting up a long-term installation. With Docker installed, run: docker run -it --name mathesar -p 8000:8000 mathesar/mathesar-prod:latest Visit http://localhost:8000/ to set up an admin user account and create a database connection. Tips when trying Mathesar locally To open a psql shell within the container, run: docker exec -it mathesar sudo -u postgres psql To stop Mathesar, press Ctrl + C in the shell where it is running. To start again, run docker start mathesar . To remove the Docker container, run docker rm mathesar . \u26a0\ufe0f This will also delete the data that you\u2019ve saved within Mathesar! Install Mathesar \u00b6 You can self-host Mathesar by following one of the guides below: Install using Docker compose \u2014 a production setup with separate reverse-proxy and database containers.

Stability The RPC API is not yet stable and may change in the future, even after we\u2019ve completed the transition to the RPC API architecture. If you build logic that depends on this API, be mindful that it may change in the future without warning or notice. Usage \u00b6 To use an RPC function: Call it with a dot path starting from its root path. Always use named parameters. Ensure that your request includes HTTP headers for valid session IDs, as well as CSRF cookies and tokens. Example To call function add_from_known_connection from the connections section of this page, you\u2019d send something like: POST /api/rpc/v0/ { \"jsonrpc\" : \"2.0\" , \"id\" : 234 , \"method\" : \"connections.add_from_known_connection\" , \"params\" : { \"nickname\" : \"anewconnection\" , \"db_name\" : \"mynewcooldb\" }, } connections \u00b6 Classes and functions exposed to the RPC endpoint for creating connections. add_from_known_connection \u00b6 add_from_known_connection ( * , nickname , database , create_db = False , connection_id = None , sample_data = []) Add a new connection from an already existing one.

If you run into any trouble, we encourage you to open an issue or submit a PR proposing changes to this file . Requirements \u00b6 System \u00b6 We recommend having at least 60 GB disk space and 4 GB of RAM. Operating System \u00b6 We\u2019ve tested this on Debian 12 , but we expect that it can be adapted for other Linux distributions as well. Access \u00b6 You should have root access to the machine you\u2019re installing Mathesar on. Software \u00b6 You\u2019ll need to install the following system packages before you install Mathesar: Python 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11 Python version Python older than 3.9 will not run Mathesar. Python 3.12 will run Mathesar, but you\u2019ll have to take extra steps to get some dependencies to build. Installing a package for your OS that provides the libpq-fe.h header file should be enough in most cases. On Debian 12, this header is provided by the libpq-dev package. PostgreSQL 13 or newer (Verify by logging in, and running the query: SELECT version(); ) Caddy (Verify with caddy version ) git (Verify with git --version ) GNU gettext (Verify with gettext --version ) Domain (optional) \u00b6 If you want Mathesar to be accessible over the internet, you\u2019ll probably want to set up a domain or sub-domain to use. If you don\u2019t need a domain, you can skip this section. Before you start installation, ensure that the DNS for your sub-domain or domain is pointing to the machine that you\u2019re installing Mathesar on . Customizing this Guide \u00b6 Type your domain name into the box below. Do not include a trailing slash. Then press Enter to customize this guide with your domain name. Installation Steps \u00b6 Set up the database \u00b6 Open a psql shell. sudo -u postgres psql # Modify based on your Postgres installation. Let\u2019s create a Postgres user for Mathesar CREATE USER mathesar WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '1234' ; Customize your password Be sure to change the password 1234 in the command above to something more secure and private. Record your custom password somewhere safe. You will need to reference it later. Next, we have to create a database for storing Mathesar metadata. Your PostgreSQL user will either need to be a SUPERUSER or OWNER of the database. In this guide, we will be setting the user to be OWNER of the database as it is slightly restrictive compared to a SUPERUSER . CREATE DATABASE mathesar_django OWNER mathesar ; Press Ctrl + D to exit the psql shell. Set up your installation directory \u00b6 Choose a directory to store the Mathesar application files. Examples /home/my_user_name/mathesar /etc/mathesar Type your installation directory into the box below. Do not include a trailing slash. Then press Enter to customize this guide with your installation directory. Create your installation directory. mkdir -p xMATHESAR_INSTALLATION_DIRx When installing outside your home folder If you choose a directory outside your home folder, then you\u2019ll need to create it with sudo and choose an appropriate owner for the directory (i.e. root or a custom user of your choosing). The remainder of this guide requires you to run commands with full permissions inside your installation directory . You can do this, for example via: chown my_user_name: xMATHESAR_INSTALLATION_DIRx Or sudo su Navigate into your installation directory. cd xMATHESAR_INSTALLATION_DIRx The remaining commands in this guide should be run from within your installation directory. Set up the environment \u00b6 Clone the git repo into the installation directory. git clone https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar.git . Checkout the tag of the latest stable release, 0.1.7 . git checkout 0.1.7 Important If you don\u2019t run the above command you\u2019ll end up installing the latest development version of Mathesar, which will be less stable. We need to create a python virtual environment for the Mathesar application. <path-to-python-binary> -m venv ./mathesar-venv # /usr/bin/python3.9 -m venv ./mathesar-venv Next we will activate our virtual environment: source ./mathesar-venv/bin/activate Important You need to activate the environment each time you restart the shell as they don\u2019t persist across sessions. Install the Mathesar application \u00b6 Install Python dependencies pip install -r requirements-prod.txt Set the environment variables Create .env file touch .env Edit your .env file, adding environment variables to configure Mathesar. Example Your .env file should look something like this DOMAIN_NAME='xDOMAIN_NAMEx' ALLOWED_HOSTS='xDOMAIN_NAMEx' SECRET_KEY='REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_RANDOMLY_GENERATED_VALUE' # REPLACE THIS! POSTGRES_DB=mathesar_django POSTGRES_USER=mathesar POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mathesar1234 # Do not use this password!

This page provides a comprehensive list of all changes in the release. Upgrading to 0.1.4 \u00b6 See our guide on upgrading Mathesar to 0.1.4 . New Features \u00b6 UI for configuring database connections \u00b6 Now you can add, edit, and delete connections to multiple databases from within Mathesar\u2019s UI. Previously this was only possible via editing text-based configuration. #3170 #3223 #3299 #3309 #3319 #3326 #3341 #3348 #3349 #3352 #3354 #3356 #3368 #3377 #3387 Sample data loader \u00b6 When adding a new database connection, you can choose to load sample data into that database. Sample data will be contained within specific schemas and may be useful to help new users play with Mathesar\u2019s features. #3368 PostgreSQL column COMMENTs \u00b6 PostgreSQL COMMENT values on columns are now exposed via a read/write \u201cdescription\u201d field within Mathesar. This feature was previously available for schemas and tables and is now available for columns too. #3186 #3219 Text-only imports \u00b6 When importing CSV data, Mathesar now gives you the option to use TEXT as the database type for all columns. This choice speeds up the import for larger data sets by skipping the process of guessing colum types. #3050 We are still considering additional ways to improve performance when importing \u2014 especially for data sets with lots of columns. Reduced database privilege installations \u00b6 Mathesar can now be installed as long as the database role used during the installation has at least CONNECT and CREATE privileges on the database targeted by the installation. If you want to create a new database for Mathesar\u2019s use, the installation will (naturally) require a role with the CREATEDB privilege. #3117 Unified Mathesar Docker image \u00b6 The published Mathesar Docker image now contains a PostgreSQL server. This is used to provide a database backend in cases where Mathesar is started via Docker without being configured to connect to any other database. #3121 #3212 Metadata storage within SQLite \u00b6 We\u2019ve added experimental SQLite support for the storage of Mathesar metadata. This will allow brave (or foolish) users to run Mathesar with this lighter-weight DB when installing from scratch on Linux. #3203 #3225 #2778 Improved PostgreSQL compatibility \u00b6 Mathesar now officially supports, and is tested against, Postgres versions 13, 14, and 15. It\u2019s also possible (but not yet recommended) to run Mathesar using Postgres 16. #3206 Easier modification of sorting precedence \u00b6 When you have multiple sorting conditions applied to a table, you can now rearrange them via drag and drop to adjust the precedence of the sorting conditions. #3316 Cell values displayed within sidebar \u00b6 The table sidebar features a new \u201cCell\u201d tab to show the content of cells, simplifying the process of viewing large text cells. Groundwork \u00b6 We made significant progress towards internationalizing Mathesar\u2019s user interface. We expect to our next release to offer users the ability to toggle between English and Japanese. Subsequent releases will continue to add additional languages. #3102 #3103 #3104 #3302 #3321 #3337 #3340 #3350 #3389 We began some work that will help us eventually distribute Mathesar via a Debian .deb package. Some additional work remains but we hope to introduce this installation method in a future version. #3189 #3225 We implemented the backend side of a new feature to import Excel and JSON files through Mathesar\u2019s import UI. More work still remains to implement the frontend side of this feature. #3083 #3195 #3132 We took some baby steps towards building a system to automatically generate human-readable documentation for all our API endpoints. Significant work still remains. #3271 #3146 Documentation \u00b6 We improved and updated our documentation for installing and updating Mathesar. ( #3227 ) Bug fixes \u00b6 Tables having CHECK constraints are now usable within Mathesar. ( #3243 ) Records can now be inserted into tables without primary keys. ( #3252 ) We fixed inconsistent state when selecting a different column while editing a column\u2019s name. ( #3219 ) URL cells now retain their focus after a contained hyperlink is clicked. ( #3012 ) Searching for a record via a partially-entered date string no longer gives an error. ( #3343 ) The Database Page now shows loading and error indicators. ( #3351 ) The Schema Page now displays more detailed information about errors encountered when loading tables and explorations. ( #3323 ) Exclusion constraint violations now produce more helpful error messages. ( #3200 ) Files with missing or duplicate id values can now be imported without error. ( #3155 ) The record selector can now be closed by clicking on the overlay outside its modal. ( #3220 ) Help text for foreign key column data types is now more accurate. ( #3260 ) Users of Mathesar\u2019s public demo site will no longer see database connections listed for other demo users. ( #3129 ) More UI elements have visually distinctive focus states. ( #3313 ) Date formatting is applied to arrays of date values. ( #3325 ) On the record page, values within foreign key columns can now be set to NULL more intuitively. ( #3310 ) A visual layout overflow bug on the record page is fixed. ( #3303 ) Foreign keys referencing non-primary-key columns now display properly. ( #3239 ) Maintenance \u00b6 We made our CI pipeline more robust. ( #3254 ) We made some updates to our workflows and developer documentation to support improvements to our issue labeling scheme. ( #3338 #3298 #3280 #3336 ) We made some routine upgrades to dependencies and small adjustments to development tooling. ( #3214 #3353 #3334 #3201 #3295 #3156 #3234 #3229 #3317 ) We addressed regressions from work during this release. ( #3197 ) We improved error handling by preventing storing non-positive IDs for certain objects.

( #3312 ) We made some improvements to our developer documentation. ( #3300 #3210 #3279 ) We improved our process for generating release notes.

They can edit all data in the schema, as well as edit the structure of data (e.g. create tables, add and remove columns, etc.). They also manage access to the schema. Editors can edit all data in the schema, but cannot change the underlying data structures or manage access. Viewers have read-only access to all data in the schema. They cannot make any changes.

Order of Precedence \u00b6 If a user has both a Database Role and a Schema Role for a schema within the same database, the Schema Role will only have an effect if it grants more permissions. Examples: If a user is a Database Manager but has Viewer permissions on a given schema, the schema role has no effect. If a user is a Database Editor but has Manager permissions on a given schema, the schema role will take precedence.","title":"Users & access levels"},{"location":"user-guide/users/#users-access-levels","text":"Mathesar allows you to set up users with different access levels.
