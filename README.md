# Mathesar
Mathesar is a web application that makes working with PostgreSQL databases both simple and powerful. It empowers users of all technical skill levels to view, edit, query, and collaborate on data with a familiar spreadsheet-like interface—no code needed. It’s self hosted, can be deployed in minutes, and works directly with PostgreSQL databases, schemas, and tables without extra abstractions. The project is 100% open source and maintained by Mathesar Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit.

Mathesar is as scalable as Postgres and supports any size or complexity of data, making it ideal for workflows involving production databases. It requires minimal setup, and integrates into your existing infrastructure. Because Mathesar is self-hosted, your data never leaves your servers, and access control based on Postgres roles and privileges keeps your database secure without adding unnecessary risk.

- **Install in minutes**: Install using Docker in minutes, integrate into any existing infrastructure.
- **Postgres-based access control**: Use existing Postgres roles within Mathesar's UI, or set up your own.
- **Interoperable with other tools**: Mathesar works harmoniously alongside your database and thousands of other tools in the Postgres ecosystem.
- **Set up your data models**: Easily create and update Postgres schemas and tables.
- **Data entry**: Use our spreadsheet-like interface to view, create, update, and delete table records.
- **Filter, sort, and group**: Quickly slice your data in different ways.
- **Query builder**: Use our Data Explorer to build queries without knowing anything about SQL or joins.
- **Import and export data**: Import and export data into Mathesar easily to work with your data elsewhere.
- **Schema migrations**: Transfer columns between tables in two clicks.
- **Uses Postgres features**: Mathesar uses and manipulates Postgres schemas, primary keys, foreign keys, constraints and data types. e.g. "Relationships" in the UI are foreign keys in the database.
- **Custom data types**: Custom data types for emails and URLs, validated at the database level.

## Our motivation
Using databases shouldn't require technical expertise or expensive, closed-off tools. Databases are incredibly powerful, but they're often trapped behind complex interfaces that are hard to use or limit how people can access and share their data. We want to change that by building user-friendly tools that unlock the power of existing databases without sacrificing accessibility, portability, or extensibility.

Mathesar is our answer: an open-source platform designed to unlock the full potential of PostgreSQL, one of the most powerful and trusted open-source databases. Mathesar is easy to use, interoperable, and extensible, while also giving you complete control over your data. As a nonprofit, we're committed to keeping Mathesar 100% open source and available to everyone—because better ways to work with data mean better decisions, and better decisions lead to a better world.

## Bugs and troubleshooting
If you run into problems, refer to our [troubleshooting guide](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md).
