# Mathesar

Mathesar is a straightforward open source tool that provides a **spreadsheet-like interface** to a PostgreSQL **database**. Our web-based interface helps you and your collaborators work with data more independently and comfortably – **no technical skills needed**.

You can use Mathesar to build **data models**, **enter data**, and even **build reports**. You host your own Mathesar installation, which gives you ownership, privacy, and control of your data.

## Live Demo
Check out a [live demo of Mathesar here](https://demo.mathesar.org)!

## Features
- **Built on Postgres**: Connect to an existing Postgres database or set one up from scratch.
- **Set up your data models**: Easily create and update Postgres schemas and tables.
- **Data entry**: Use our spreadsheet-like interface to view, create, update, and delete table records.
- **Filter, sort, and group**: Quickly slice your data in different ways.
- **Query builder**: Use our Data Explorer to build queries without knowing anything about SQL or joins.
- **Schema migrations**: Transfer columns between tables in two clicks.
- **Uses Postgres features**: Mathesar uses and manipulates Postgres schemas, primary keys, foreign keys, constraints and data types. e.g. "Links" in the UI are foreign keys in the database.
- **Custom data types**: Custom data types for emails and URLs (more coming soon), validated at the database level.
- **Basic access control**: Users can have Viewer (read-only), Editor (can only edit data, but not data structure), or Manager (can edit both data and its structure) roles.

## Self-hosting
Please see [our documentation](https://docs.mathesar.org/) for instructions on installing Mathesar on your own server.

## Local development setup
Please see [our guide in our documentation](http://docs.mathesar.org/contributing/local-dev/).

## Our motivation
Mathesar is a non-profit project. Our goal is to make understanding and working with data easy for everyone.

Databases have been around for a long time and solve common data problems really well. But working with databases often requires custom software. Or complex tooling that people struggle to get their heads around.

We want to make existing database functionality more accessible, for users of all technical skill levels.
