## After installing Mathesar

Congratulations on your new Mathesar install! After getting up in running, you may want to take some additional steps:

### Connect your production database(s)

See our [instructions for connecting Databases to Mathesar](../user-guide/databases.md#connection) to begin working with your data.

### Add a custom domain name (optional)

By default, Digital Ocean will give your Mathesar installation its own secured domain name, like `https://mathesar-*.ondigitalocean.app/`.

You can easily add a custom domain name by following Digital Ocean's guide on [Adding a custom domain using their control panel](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/how-to/manage-domains/#custom-domain).
