## Why Choose DigitalOcean App Platform?

[DigitalOcean App Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform) simplifies deploying, scaling, and managing Mathesar without worrying about underlying infrastructure management. It's ideal for:

- Beginners who need an easy, quick setup without delving into infrastructure specifics.
- Small to medium-sized teams looking for reliable hosting with minimal overhead.
- Developers who prefer easy scaling, clear pricing, and stability without needing to SSH into servers or manually manage configuration.

## After succesfully installing Mathesar

### Secure your installation with a `SECRET_KEY` (Strongly Recommended)

### Connect your production database(s)

### Add a custom domain name (optional)

By default, Digital Ocean will give your Mathesar installation its own secured domain name, like `https://mathesar-*.ondigitalocean.app/`.

You can easily add a custom domain name by following Digital Ocean's guide on [Adding a custom domain using their control panel](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/how-to/manage-domains/#custom-domain).
