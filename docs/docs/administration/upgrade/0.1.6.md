# Upgrade Mathesar to 0.1.6

### For installations using Docker Compose

If you have a Docker compose installation (including one from the guided script), run the command below:

```
docker compose -f /etc/mathesar/docker-compose.yml up --pull always -d
```

!!! warning "Your installation directory may be different"
    You may need to change `/etc/mathesar/` in the command above if you chose to install Mathesar to a different directory.


### For installations done from scratch

If you installed Mathesar [from scratch](../../installation/build-from-source/index.md), then use these steps to upgrade your installation to 0.1.6.

1. Go to your Mathesar installation directory

    ```
    cd xMATHESAR_INSTALLATION_DIRx
    ```

    !!! note
        Your installation directory may be different from above if you used a different directory when installing Mathesar.

1. Checkout version 0.1.6 from the repository

    ```
    git pull https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar.git
    git checkout 0.1.6
    ```

1. Update Python dependencies

    ```
    pip install -r requirements-prod.txt
    ```

1. Activate our virtual environment

    ```
    source ./mathesar-venv/bin/activate
    ```

1. You can skip the following if you're upgrading from versions 0.1.4 and above.
    - If you're upgrading from versions <= 0.1.3, update your environment variables according to the [the new configuration specification](../../configuration/env-variables.md#db).
    - In particular, you must put the connection info for the internal DB into new `POSTGRES_*` variables. The `DJANGO_DATABASE_URL` variable is no longer supported.

1. Add the environment variables to the shell before running Django commands

    ```
    export $(sudo cat .env)
    ```

1. Run Django migrations

    ```
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

1. Download and extract frontend assets

    ```
    wget https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar/releases/download/0.1.6/static_files.zip
    unzip static_files.zip && mv static_files mathesar/static/mathesar && rm static_files.zip
    ```

1. Compile Mathesar translation files

    ```
    python manage.py compilemessages
    ```

1. Update Mathesar functions on the database:

    ```
    python -m mathesar.install --skip-confirm | tee /tmp/install.py.log
    ```

1. Restart the gunicorn server

    ```
    systemctl restart gunicorn
    ```
