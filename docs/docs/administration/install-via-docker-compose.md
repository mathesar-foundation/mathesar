1. Download our [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar/raw/{{mathesar_version}}/docker-compose.yml) file.

    ```
    wget https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar/raw/{{mathesar_version}}/docker-compose.yml
    ```

1. Open the downloaded docker-compose file using your text editor.

1. Set the required environment variables in the **x-config** section of the docker compose file.
    
    !!! Config       
        ```yaml
        x-config: &config
          # (REQUIRED) Replace '?' with '-' followed by a 50 character random string.
          # You can generate one at https://djecrety.ir/ or by running:
          #   echo $(cat /dev/urandom | LC_CTYPE=C tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | head -c 50)
          SECRET_KEY: ${SECRET_KEY:?}

          # (Optional) Replace 'http://localhost' with custom domain(s) e.g.
          # 'yourdomain.com, 127.0.0.1' to manage the host(s) at which you want to
          # access Mathesar over http or https
          DOMAIN_NAME: ${DOMAIN_NAME:-http://localhost}

          # Edit the POSTGRES_* variables if you are not using the db service provided
          # below, or if you want to use a custom database user.

          # (Optional) Replace 'mathesar_django' with any custom name for the internal
          # database managed by mathesar web-service
          POSTGRES_DB: ${POSTGRES_DB:-mathesar_django}

          # (Optional) Replace 'mathesar' with any custom username for the
          # aforementioned database
          POSTGRES_USER: ${POSTGRES_USER:-mathesar}

          # (Optional) Replace 'mathesar' with any custom password for the
          # aforementioned database
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-mathesar}

          # (Optional) Replace 'mathesar_db' with the name of the host running postgres
          POSTGRES_HOST: ${POSTGRES_HOST:-mathesar_db}

          # (Optional) Replace '5432' with the port on which postgres is running
          POSTGRES_PORT: ${POSTGRES_PORT:-5432}
        ```

1. Run the docker compose file using:
        ```
        docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up
        ```

1. Set up your user account

    Mathesar is now installed! You can use it by visiting `localhost` or the domain you've set up. You'll be prompted to set up an admin user account the first time you open Mathesar. Just follow the instructions on screen.

## Starting and stopping Mathesar {:#start-stop}

The Mathesar server needs to be running for you to use Mathesar. If you restart your machine, you'll need to start the server again.

- **Start** Mathesar:

    ```
    docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
    ```

    !!! Info
        Exclude the `-d` flag if you'd like to see the container's logs.

- **Stop** Mathesar:

    ```
    docker compose -f docker-compose.yml down
    ```

    This stops all Mathesar Docker containers and releases their ports.

## Optional configurations

### Hosting Mathesar over a custom domain with https

If you want Mathesar to be accessible over the internet, you'll probably want to set up a domain or sub-domain to use. **If you don't need a domain, you can skip this section.**

**Ensure that the DNS for your domain or sub-domain is pointing to the public IP address of the machine that you're installing Mathesar on**.

Add your domain(s) or sub-domain(s) to the [`DOMAIN_NAME`](../../configuration/env-variables/#domain_name) environment variable, in the **CONFIG** section of the docker-compose file.

!!! example
    ```yaml
    DOMAIN_NAME: ${DOMAIN_NAME:-yourdomain.org,yoursubdomain.example.org}
    ```

Restart the docker containers for the configuration to take effect.

### Using an external PostgreSQL server for Mathesar's internal database

If you'd like to use an external PostgreSQL server for Mathesar's internal database, you'll need to do the following:


1. On your PostgreSQL server, [create a new database](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createdatabase.html) for Mathesar to store its metadata.

    ```bash
    psql -c 'create database mathesar_django;'
    ```

1. Configure the [internal database environment variables](./environment-variables.md#db) to point to the database you just created. Ensure that you change the default values for the user, password, and host.
