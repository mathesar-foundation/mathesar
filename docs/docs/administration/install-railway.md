# Install Mathesar on Railway

This guide walks you through how to deploy Mathesar on Railway.

??? tip "Railway vs. other deployment methods"
	Deploying using Railway works really well for:

	- Users who are new to self-hosting but want a long-term, low-maintenance deployment.
	- Users who do not have the capacity or interest in manually managing server infrastructure, scaling, or observability.
	- Users who want to integrate Mathesar into a broader application stack using GUI tooling.

	[DigitalOcean](./install-digitalocean.md) also works well for this use case. If you need more flexibility or configurability, we recommend using our [Docker Compose](./install-via-docker-compose.md) or [direct](./install-from-scratch.md) installation methods instead.


## Installation

### Step 1: Run the one-click deployer

!!! info "Railway trial accounts"
	If you sign up with GitHub and your account meets Railway's [requirements](https://docs.railway.com/reference/pricing/free-trial#full-vs-limited-trial), you'll receive a "full" free trial and be able to install Mathesar immediately.

	Otherwise, you'll be placed on a "limited" trial, which doesn't support code deployment. Instead, Railway will prompt you to upgrade to one of their "Hobby"-tier monthly plans in order to deploy Mathesar.

### Step 2: Create the application

**Press the "Deploy" button.**

It will take a minute or two for Railway to set up your installation. Once ready, you will see your domain name and a link to visit your new Mathesar site.

### Step 3: Set up an admin user account

Navigate to your Mathesar installation using the link that Railway shows you.

Youâ€™ll be prompted to set up an admin user account the first time you open Mathesar. Just follow the instructions on screen.

### Step 4: Additional setup (optional)

Congratulations on your new Mathesar install!

Here are some other things you can do to complete your Mathesar setup, depending on your needs:

- [Connect your existing database(s) to Mathesar](../user-guide/databases.md#connection) or create a new database in the Mathesar UI to begin working with your data.
- [Set up a custom domain name in Railway](https://docs.railway.com/guides/public-networking#custom-domains) if you don't want to use their default domain e.g. `https://mathesar-*.up.railway.app`.
