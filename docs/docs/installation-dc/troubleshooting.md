# Troubleshooting

## Restarting installation
If you need to re-start installation for any reason, please do not re-run the installation script! You'll need to run the [uninstall steps](./uninstall.md) before trying to run the installation script again.

## Docker versions

The most common problem we've encountered is users with out-of-date `docker` or `docker-compose` versions.

- To determine your `docker-compose` version, run `docker compose version`. (Note the lack of hyphen.) You need `docker-compose` version 2.7 or higher for the installation to succeed. Better if it's version 2.10 or higher.
- To determine your `docker` version, run `docker --version`. We've tested with `docker` version 23, but lower versions may work.

If you run `docker-compose --version` and see a relatively old version, try `docker compose version` and see whether it's different. The latter is the version that will be used in the script.

## Ports
You may see errors about various ports being unavailable (or already being bound). In this case, please run
```sh
sudo docker compose -f /etc/mathesar/docker-compose.yml --profile prod down --rmi all -v
```
to restart from a clean `docker` state, and choose non-default ports during the installation process for PostgreSQL, HTTP traffic, or HTTPS traffic as appropriate, e.g., using `8080` for HTTP traffic if `80` is unavailable. Note that if you customized the configuration directory, you must replace `/etc/mathesar` with that custom directory in the command.

## Connection problems

In order for Mathesar to install properly, it needs to download some artifacts from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com`. We've received some reports that this domain is blocked for some internet providers in India. If this is the case for you, consider routing around that problem via a custom DNS server, or using a VPN.

## Permissions

If you have permissions issues when the script begins running `docker` commands, please double-check that your user is in the `sudoers` file. Try running `sudo -v`. If that gives an error, your user lacks needed permissions and you should speak with the administrator of your system.
