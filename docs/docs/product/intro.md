# Introduction

Welcome! At this point, we assume you've installed Mathesar successfully and have logged into the web UI.

If you've connected Mathesar to an existing database, you should see all your schemas once you log in, and you can work with them as you please.

If you're starting from scratch, we recommend **creating a new schema**.
