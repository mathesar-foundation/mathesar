# Syncing Database Changes

Mathesar is designed to be used in tandem with other database tools. This means that if you make changes to your database structure or data outside of Mathesar, those changes will be reflected in Mathesar's UI.

If you make structural changes to the database outside Mathesar (e.g. using another tool to add a schema, table, or column), those changes will not be reflected in Mathesar until you manually sync them. You can sync them using the "Sync Database Changes" button in the database homepage.

External changes to data (e.g. adding, editing, or deleting *records*) will be automatically reflected without clicking this button.
