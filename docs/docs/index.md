# Mathesar Documentation

![Mathesar header](assets/images/header.png)

Mathesar is a straightforward open source tool that provides a **spreadsheet-like interface** to a PostgreSQL **database**. Our web-based interface helps you and your collaborators work with data more independently and comfortably â€“ **no technical skills needed**.

You can use Mathesar to build **data models**, **enter data**, and even **build reports**.

## Get started

- [Install Mathesar](installation/index.md)
- [Configure Environment Variables](configuration/env-variables.md)

## Product
Mathesar should be pretty intuitive to use. More documentation is coming soon, but for now, we've written some documentation for some things that could be tricky.

- [Syncing Database Changes](./user-guide/syncing-db.md)
