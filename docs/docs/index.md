# Mathesar Documentation


## Welcome!
Mathesar is a self-hostable open source project that provides a spreadsheet-like interface to a PostgreSQL database. Our web-based interface helps you and your collaborators set up data models, edit data, and build custom reports â€“ no technical skills needed. 

You can create a new PostgreSQL database while setting up Mathesar or use our UI to interact with an existing database (or do both).

A live demo of Mathesar is [available here](https://demo.mathesar.org/).

## Installing Mathesar
You can self-host Mathesar by following one of the guides below:  

- [Install with Docker Compose](installation/docker-compose/index.md)
- [Install from scratch (on Linux)](installation/build-from-source/index.md)
- [Install with our guided installation script](installation/guided-install/index.md)
- [Install using Docker image (needs an external database server)](installation/docker/index.md)

!!! info "More installation methods coming soon"
    We're working on supporting additional installation methods, and we'd appreciate feedback on which ones to prioritize. Please comment [on this issue](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues/2509) if you have thoughts.

## Using Mathesar
Mathesar should be pretty intuitive to use. More documentation is coming soon, but for now, we've written some documentation for some things that could be tricky.
