# Mathesar Documentation

Mathesar is an open source and web-based interface that works on top of your database.

Perhaps you'd like to [install Mathesar](installation/docker-compose.md).

If you're a developer, consider looking at the [git repo](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar). The `README.md` there will get you started with helping us develop Mathesar.
