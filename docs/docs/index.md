# Mathesar Documentation


## Welcome!
Mathesar is an self-hostable open source project that provides a spreadsheet-like interface to a PostgreSQL database. Our web-based interface helps you and your collaborators set up data models, edit data, and build custom reports – no technical skills needed. You can create a new PostgreSQL database while setting up Mathesar or use our UI to interact with an existing database (or do both).

A live demo of Mathesar is [available here](https://demo.mathesar.org/).

## Installing Mathesar


- [Install Mathesar](installation/index.md)
- [Configure Environment Variables](configuration/env-variables.md)

## Product
Mathesar should be pretty intuitive to use. More documentation is coming soon, but for now, we've written some documentation for some things that could be tricky.
