# Mathesar Documentation

## Welcome!

Mathesar is a self-hostable open source project that provides a spreadsheet-like interface to a PostgreSQL database. Our web-based interface helps you and your collaborators set up data models, edit data, and build custom reports &mdash; no technical skills needed. You can create a new PostgreSQL database while setting up Mathesar or use our UI to interact with an existing database (or do both).

Try our [live demo](https://demo.mathesar.org/) to play with Mathesar before installing it.

See our [conceptual overview](./concepts.md) to learn more about the inner workings of Mathesar.

## Installing Mathesar

You can self-host Mathesar by following one of the guides below:

- [Install using Docker image](installation/docker/index.md)
- [Install using Debian package](installation/debian/index.md)

!!! info "More installation methods coming soon"
    We're working on supporting additional installation methods, and we'd appreciate feedback on which ones to prioritize. Please comment [on this issue](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues/2509) if you have thoughts.

## Using Mathesar

Mathesar should be pretty intuitive to use. More documentation is coming soon, but for now, we've written some documentation for some things that could be tricky.
