# Mathesar Documentation

![Mathesar header](assets/images/header.png)

Mathesar is a straightforward open source tool that provides a **spreadsheet-like interface** to a PostgreSQL **database**. Our web-based interface helps you and your collaborators work with data more independently and comfortably – **no technical skills needed**.

You can use Mathesar to build **data models**, **enter data**, and even **build reports**.

## Installation

[Install Mathesar](install/index.md)

## Product
Mathesar should be pretty intuitive to use. More documentation is coming soon, but for now, we've written some documentation for some things that could be tricky.
