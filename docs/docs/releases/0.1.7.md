## Bug fixes

### Fixed Regeneration of Exploration Share URL

Fixed an issue where clicking "Regenerate Link" for a shared exploration failed to create a new URL and resulted in a 404 API request. Now, users will see a successful API call with a new, regenerated share URL.

### Remove 'group' Suffix in Data Explorer

Resolved an issue in the Data Explorer where the grouping column name was incorrectly suffixed with 'group'. Now, the original column names are preserved when summarizing data.
