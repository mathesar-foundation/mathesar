### Docker Compose installs are updated to Postgres 17

!!! info "For existing users"

    Existing users who would like to update to Postgres 17 should use our new docker compose file and run `cp -r msar msar.backup` prior to upgrading Postgres in the event of issues.

  New installs of Mathesar using our recommended [Docker Compose](../administration/install-via-docker-compose.md) installation will now use Postgres 17. Prior to 1.2.1 Mathesar installs configured via our docker compose file used version 13.
