# Mathesar 0.2.0 (beta)

## Summary

Version 0.2.0 is Mathesar's first **beta** release and features a brand new [access control system](#permissions), massive [performance improvements](#performance), and an important [security fix](#data-files).

!!! caution ""
    Upgrading directly from previous versions to `0.2.0` is not supported.
    Don’t worry—**your databases can still be migrated to `0.2.0` using the instructions provided [below](#migrate).**

_This page provides a comprehensive list of all changes since version 0.1.7._

## Security Fixes

### Fix unauthorized access to cached import data {:#data-files}

- **Risk**: Information disclosure
- **Severity**: Low-medium
- **Affected versions**: 0.1.0 - 0.1.7
- **Description**:

    Mathesar has a feature to import data into a new table via uploading a CSV file. During the import process, the uploaded CSV file is cached within Mathesar and never actually deleted.

    Prior to version 0.2.0, all authenticated users were able to use Mathesar's API to read the cached data for all imports which had ever been performed by any user. This could allow one authenticated user to maliciously read another user's uploaded data. (Anonymous users are not affected — they have never been able to read any cached import data.)

    From version 0.2.0 onwards, Mathesar only allows each user to read _their own_ cached import data.

    If any of your users might have imported CSV data through Mathesar which they would like to keep private from _other users within the same Mathesar installation_, then we recommend moving your Mathesar installation to 0.2.0.

- **Fixed via**: [#4157](https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar/pull/4157)

- **Work-around**:

    To mitigate an older version of Mathesar against this vulnerability _without_ upgrading, you can delete all the cached import data files with the following steps.

    ??? info "How to delete your cached import data files"
        1. Run `docker ps` to identify the name of your running Mathesar container. This is commonly named `mathesar_service` but might vary depending on how you have installed Mathesar
        1. Run `docker exec -it mathesar_service bash` to open a shell within your running Mathesar service container. (Replace "mathesar_service" with the name of your container determined above, if needed.)
        1. From within the shell, run the following command to _list_ your cached import data files.

            ```
            ls -la /code/.media/*
            ```
        1. Run the following command to _remove all_ your cached import data files:

            ```
            rm -rf /code/.media/*
            ```

    Note that after performing this work-around, subsequent imports will still be vulnerable to this bug until you upgrade to Mathesar 0.2.0.

## Improvements

### New access control system based on PostgreSQL roles and privileges {:#permissions}

We've completely redesigned Mathesar's [access controls](../user-guide/access-control.md) to leverage PostgreSQL's powerful system of roles and privileges. Each Mathesar user will now be assigned to a specific PostgreSQL role so that all their operations on the underlying database will be performed using that role.

![A screenshot of Mathesar's UI showing the "Add Collaborator" modal for a database.](../assets/releases/0.2.0/add-collaborator.png)

The new system gives Mathesar several new capabilities. You can use Mathesar to configure roles and privileges in PostgreSQL and to set granular access control at the individual schema and table level. Plus Mathesar will respect all these configurations when performed directly in PostgreSQL by database administrators outside of Mathesar. Mathesar also no longer needs a database superuser for day-to-day operations.

### Substantial performance improvements {:#performance}

Mathesar is now much faster! Most pages load about 5x faster, and large imports run about 50x faster.

Also, you'll no longer need to manually "sync database schema changes" to Mathesar. Now, any DDL changes will be reflected in Mathesar automatically!

To achieve these gains, we've significantly overhauled Mathesar's backend architecture, moving a large chunk of the application code into the database itself, and migrating to a new [API](../api/index.md).

<!-- TODO_SCREENSHOT: It could be neat to produce a bar chart here showing page load times across a few pages on 0.1.7 (prod) vs 0.2.0 (prod). This would take some time, but might be worth it.

Some pages in the library management schema that would demo perf improvements well:

- The record page for Author id 225 Robert Jordan
- The books table
- Importing something

### Table exports

You can now use Mathesar to [export a table](../user-guide/exporting-data.md) to a CSV file. Any filters and sorting that you've applied to the table will be reflected in the exported data. And all relevant records will be included in the export, even if they are not shown on the current page within Mathesar.

[#4090](https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar/pull/4090 "Add ability to export tables")

### More options when disconnecting a database

When disconnecting a database from Mathesar, you can now choose to remove the Mathesar schemas from the database.

### More sample data

Mathesar now give you the option to load several new sample data sets when connecting a database.

<!-- TODO_SCREENSHOT: "Create a New Database" modal with all boxes checked -->

[#4142](https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar/pull/4142 "Add beta dataset loaders to setup RPC functions")


### Optional (anonymous) usage reporting

To help us better understand the ways in which people are using Mathesar, we've added a new feature which periodically reports anonymous usage data about each Mathesar installation to the maintainers team. Upon installing (or upgrading to) Mathesar 0.2.0, Mathesar will give you an opportunity to opt out of usage data collection if you so choose. You can access this setting later by visiting the "Administration" > "Privacy" page within Mathesar.

This usage data will help us make Mathesar better! And it will help us demonstrate Mathesar's traction and impact to potential donors — so we encourage you to enable it.

![A screenshot of Mathesar's UI showing the "Privacy" page with a checkbox to opt out of data collection.](../assets/releases/0.2.0/usage-stats.png)

We do not collect any personal or sensitive data!

## Features removed

### Sharable tables and explorations are no longer available

Back in version 0.1.3, we added support for "sharing" tables and explorations via a link that would allow anonymous users to view data. In Mathesar 0.2.0, we've removed this feature in order to speed up the development of our new PostgreSQL-based access control system. If you were relying on this feature, we'd like to hear from you! Please [open an issue](https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) to let us know.


### Mathesar's _internal_ database may no longer be SQLite

Version 0.2.0 removes support for SQLite as an [internal database](../user-guide/databases.md#internal). If you were relying on this feature, we'd like to hear from you! Please [open an issue](https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) to let us know.

## Migrating to 0.2.0 from previous versions {:#migrate}

Mathesar 0.2.0 is our first beta release. As such, direct upgrades from our alpha versions are not supported.

However, you can migrate the databases created in older versions to work with 0.2.0 by following the steps below.

### Migration Overview
- **What you can migrate**: the databases you've created/connected and the data within them.
- **What you cannot migrate**: [user](../user-guide/users.md) accounts, passwords, [explorations](../user-guide/data-explorer.md), and [metadata](../user-guide/metadata.md).
- Here’s what we’ll do:
    - Take note of the databases you’ve created or connected in your current Mathesar setup.
    - Install Mathesar `0.2.0`.
    - Reconnect the databases you had before.

!!! question "When should I perform these steps?"
    - If any of your connected databases reside inside Mathesar's internal database server (_inside_ Docker containers), then you will need to perform these steps.
    - If all of your connected databases reside in PostgreSQL servers _outside_ the Mathesar's Docker containers, then you could install 0.2.0 and reconnect your databases.

### For installations using Docker Compose

These instructions are for if you have a Docker compose installation (including one from the guided script).

!!! caution ""
    These steps assume that you're using our provided `docker-compose.yml` file, and the installation directory is `/etc/mathesar`.

    If you have installed Mathesar in a different location or heavily modified the `docker-compose.yml`, you may need to change some details of the provided commands.


1. With your old version of Mathesar still running, log into your internal database server:

    ```bash
    docker exec -it mathesar_db psql -U mathesar -d mathesar_django
    ```

    (This assumes your installation DB role is `mathesar`. Modify if necessary.)

1. At the `psql` prompt, run:

    ```sql
    SELECT db_name,host,port FROM mathesar_database;
    ```

    - The above SQL query will provide the list of connected database names along with their hosts and port.
    - Copy and paste them in a text file somewhere. We will need them after installing 0.2.0.

1. Then create a temporary database:

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE mathesar_temp;
    ```

1. Log out with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd>, and log into the `mathesar_temp` database:

    ```bash
    docker exec -it mathesar_db psql -U mathesar -d mathesar_temp
    ```

1. Then drop the old Mathesar Django database, and create a new one:

    ```sql
    DROP DATABASE mathesar_django;
    ```

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE mathesar_django OWNER mathesar;
    ```

    (Modify `mathesar` above to set the owner to whichever role you use to run Mathesar.)

1. Log out with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd>, and log into your new `mathesar_django` database:

    ```bash
    docker exec -it mathesar_db psql -U mathesar -d mathesar_django
    ```

1. Then drop the temporary database:

    ```sql
    DROP DATABASE mathesar_temp;
    ```

1. Log out with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd>.

1. Stop Mathesar.

    ```
    docker compose -f /etc/mathesar/docker-compose.yml down
    ```

1. Rename the old docker-compose file.

    ```
    mv /etc/mathesar/docker-compose.yml /etc/mathesar/docker-compose.old.yml
    ```

1. Download the 0.2.0 [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar/raw/0.2.0/docker-compose.yml) file and place it within `/etc/mathesar`.

    ```
    cd /etc/mathesar
    ```

    ```
    wget https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar/raw/0.2.0/docker-compose.yml
    ```

1. Modify it as per the [installation instructions](../administration/install-via-docker-compose.md), using values from your old `docker-compose.old.yml` file.

1. Run the command below:

    ```
    docker compose -f /etc/mathesar/docker-compose.yml up --pull always -d
    ```

1. After Mathesar starts, connect to the databases using the "Connect to an Existing Database" option on the UI.
    - Use the db_name, host, and port information from the previous database backup list to fill the form.
    - For the `mathesar_db` host, the Role Name and Password can be found from the values of `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` environment variables.
    - The values for these environment variables can be found in the `docker-compose.yml` file, or if you've customized them, in your `.env` file.
    - The default values for them are `mathesar` and `mathesar`.
    - If you have any external hosts (other than `mathesar_db`), you should probably have the postgres user and passwords with you.

### For installations done from scratch

For these instructions, you'll need to be familiar enough with your setup to log into your internal Mathesar Database.

!!! caution ""
    These steps assume that the installation directory is `/etc/mathesar`.

    If you have installed Mathesar in a different location, you may need to change some details of the provided commands.

1. Log into your `mathesar_django` database, and run:

    ```sql
    SELECT db_name,host,port FROM mathesar_database;
    ```

    - The above SQL query will provide the list of connected database names along with their hosts and port.
    - Copy and paste them in a text file somewhere. We will need them after installing 0.2.0.

1. Then create a temporary database:

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE mathesar_temp;
    ```

1. Log out with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd>, and log into the `mathesar_temp` database.

1. Then drop the old Mathesar Django database, and create a new one:

    ```sql
    DROP DATABASE mathesar_django;
    ```

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE mathesar_django OWNER mathesar;
    ```

    (Modify `mathesar` above to set the owner to whichever role you use to run Mathesar.)

1. Log out with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd>, and log into your new `mathesar_django` database.

1. Then drop the temporary database:

    ```sql
    DROP DATABASE mathesar_temp;
    ```

1. Log out with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd>.

1. Stop Mathesar if it's running.

1. Delete your previous Mathesar installation directory

    ```
    rm -rf /etc/mathesar
    ```

1. Install Mathesar 0.2.0 using [the installation steps](../administration/install-from-scratch.md) in the same location: `/etc/mathesar`. You would not have to setup a PostgreSQL database since you already have one running.

1. After Mathesar starts, connect to the databases using the "Connect to an Existing Database" option on the UI.
    - Use the db_name from the previous database backup list to fill the Database Name in the form.
    - The Host name would be same as the value of `POSTGRES_HOST` environment variable for the databases created via Mathesar.
    - The Role Name and Password can be found from the values of `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` environment variables.
    - The values for these environment variables can be found in your `.env` file.
    - If you have any external hosts (other than the one in `POSTGRES_HOST`), you should probably have the postgres user and passwords with you.
