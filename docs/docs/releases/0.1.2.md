# Mathesar 0.1.2 (alpha release)

This release focuses on documenting additional options for installing Mathesar, some improvements to the user experience, and some bug fixes. We've also added support for switching between multiple databases in the UI.

## Improvements to the UI

- We've disabled setting columns to JSON List and Map types using the UI until we have a better editing experience for cells of those types. _([#2772](https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar/pull/2772))_
- Filter conditions can now be added and removed via the column header menu _([#2782](https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar/pull/2782))_
