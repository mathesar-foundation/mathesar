# Mathesar 0.7.1

!!! question "Want cross-table editing in Mathesar? Talk to us!"
	For our next release, we're actively working on the ability to edit data from multiple tables in a single view.

	If you're interested, we'd love your input so we're prioritizing the right problems to solve. [Talk to us for 20 min](https://cal.com/mathesar/users), we'll give you a $25 gift card as a thank you.

## Summary

Mathesar 0.7.1 fixes a critical bug that prevented casting database column types from one type to another. This bug most impacted CSV imports, particularly when importing data into new tables or when Mathesar's type inference system needed to adjust column types during the import process. The bug could also affect manual column type changes in existing tables.

## Bug fixes

### Fix column type casting regression

A regression introduced in 0.7.0 caused failures when casting columns between certain database types, particularly when converting between numeric and money types. The casting function was incorrectly applying currency-related formatting options (like currency prefixes and suffixes) to numeric columns that don't support them, and was not properly handling cases where cast options were empty or not applicable to the target type.

## Documentation

- Update the URL to Mathesar's Railway 1-click deployment template [#4967](https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar/pull/4967 "Fix railway link in docs")

## Upcoming changes in 0.8.0

Mathesar's 0.8.0 release will end official support for PostgreSQL 13 and Python 3.9. We recommend upgrading these dependencies prior to installing 0.8.0 to ensure continued compatibility and support.

While Mathesar is likely to function with older versions, compatibility is no longer tested, and assistance cannot be provided for issues encountered on unsupported versions.

## Upgrading to 0.7.1 {:#upgrading}

### For installations using Docker Compose

If you have a Docker compose installation, run the command below:

```
docker compose -f /etc/mathesar/docker-compose.yml up --pull always -d
```

!!! warning "Your installation directory may be different"
    You may need to change `/etc/mathesar/` in the command above if you chose to install Mathesar to a different directory.

### For direct installations of Mathesar on Linux, macOS, or WSL

Mathesar provides an install script that automates both fresh installs and upgrades for standalone (non-Docker) installations.

Follow the steps below to upgrade Mathesar:


1. Enter your installation directory into the box below and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to personalize this guide:

    <input data-input-for="MATHESAR_INSTALL_DIR" aria-label="Your Mathesar installation directory"/>

    - Do _not_ include a trailing slash.
    - Do _not_ use any variables like `$HOME`.

2.  Go to your Mathesar installation directory.

    ```
    cd xMATHESAR_INSTALL_DIRx
    ```

    !!! note
        Your installation directory may be different from above if you used a different directory when installing Mathesar.

3. Download and run the install script for 0.7.1
    ```
    curl -sSfL https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar/releases/download/0.7.1/install.sh -o install.sh
    chmod +x install.sh

    ./install.sh .
    ```

4. Replace your gunicorn systemd service with a Mathesar systemd service

    1. Disable and stop the existing gunicorn service
        ```
        systemctl disable gunicorn.service
        systemctl stop gunicorn.service
        ```

    2. Follow the steps in [Run Mathesar as a systemd service](../administration/install-from-scratch.md#run-mathesar-as-a-systemd-service) from the installation guide

    3. Remove the gunicorn service file
        ```
        sudo rm /lib/systemd/system/gunicorn.service
        ```

5. Update your Caddyfile

    1. Use the configuration shown in [Install and configure Caddy](../administration//install-from-scratch.md#install-and-configure-caddy) in the installation guide, and update your Caddyfile accordingly

    2. Ensure that your domains are specified directly in the first line of the Caddyfile

    3. Restart your Caddy service
      ```
      systemctl restart caddy.service
      ```

!!! tip
    **If you're running Mathesar only on localhost and do not want it to run as a service**, you could:

    1. Remove the gunicorn and caddy services
    1. Start Mathesar manually with:
      ```
      mathesar run
      ```
