# Mathesar 0.1.6

## Summary

Mathesar 0.1.6 introduces Japanese localization of the UI and adds better support for working with long text in individual record pages. Improvements for administrators include compatibility with Python 3.10 and 3.11, support for databases running PostgreSQL 16, and the removal of `npm` and `nodejs` as dependencies when installing from scratch. 

See the [upgrading](#upgrading) section below for instructions on how to upgrade to this version.

_This page provides a comprehensive list of all changes in the release._

## Improvements

### You can now configure Mathesar's UI to display in Japanese

The language setting is stored per-user and can be modified when logging in or when editing a user. This changes the text displayed on buttons and other UI elements within Mathesar. It does not change the display of data within your database (e.g. table names, column names, and cell values). We are hoping to support more languages beyond English and Japanese eventually. Please reach out to us if your are interested in helping to add more translations!

### Text fields now auto-expands on the record page to accommodate longer texts

**Before**

All text inputs on the record page had the same height, regardless of their content.

**After**

All text inputs in record page dynamically adjust to accommodate the content seamlessly.

### Mathesar is now compatible with Python versions: 3.10 and 3.11 along with 3.9

Mathesar now officially supports Python versions 3.10 and 3.11, in addition to the existing 3.9 compatibility. This will provide great flexibility while building Mathesar from source on an OS that natively ships with relatively newer versions of Python.

### Mathesar is now compatible with PostgreSQL 16

Mathesar now officially supports, and is tested against, Postgres versions 13, 14, 15 and 16.

_[#3480](https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar/pull/3480 "Add PG 16 to testing matrix")_

### NodeJS is no longer a requirement for building Mathesar from source

We removed NodeJS as a dependency in favour of providing users with pre-built static assest for building Mathesar from source.

## Upgrading to Mathesar 0.1.6 {:#upgrading}

### For installations using Docker Compose

If you have a Docker compose installation (including one from the guided script), run the command below:

```
docker compose -f /etc/mathesar/docker-compose.yml up --pull always -d
```

!!! warning "Your installation directory may be different"
    You may need to change `/etc/mathesar/` in the command above if you chose to install Mathesar to a different directory.


### For installations done from scratch

If you installed Mathesar [from scratch](../administration/install-from-scratch.md), then use these steps to upgrade your installation to 0.1.6.

1. Go to your Mathesar installation directory

    ```
    cd xMATHESAR_INSTALLATION_DIRx
    ```

    !!! note
        Your installation directory may be different from above if you used a different directory when installing Mathesar.

1. Pull version 0.1.6 from the repository

    ```
    git pull https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar.git
    git checkout 0.1.6
    ```

1. Update Python dependencies

    ```
    pip install -r requirements-prod.txt
    ```

1. Activate our virtual environment

    ```
    source ./mathesar-venv/bin/activate
    ```

1. You can skip the following if you're upgrading from versions 0.1.4 and above.
    - If you're upgrading from versions <= 0.1.3, update your environment variables according to the [the new configuration specification](../administration/environment-variables.md#db).
    - In particular, you must put the connection info for the internal DB into new `POSTGRES_*` variables. The `DJANGO_DATABASE_URL` variable is no longer supported.

1. Add the environment variables to the shell before running Django commands

    ```
    export $(sudo cat .env)
    ```

1. Run Django migrations

    ```
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

    wget https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar/releases/download/0.1.6/static_files.zip
    unzip static_files.zip && mv static_files mathesar/static/mathesar && rm static_files.zip
    ```

1. Compile Mathesar translation files

    ```
    python manage.py compilemessages
    ```

1. Update Mathesar functions on the database:

    ```
    python -m mathesar.install --skip-confirm | tee /tmp/install.py.log
    ```

1. Restart the gunicorn server

    ```
    systemctl restart gunicorn
    ```
