# Mathesar 0.1.6

## Summary

Mathesar 0.1.6 introduces Japanese localization of the UI and adds better support for working with long text in individual record pages. Improvements for administrators include compatibility with Python 3.10 and 3.11, support for databases running PostgreSQL 16, and the removal of `npm` and `nodejs` as dependencies when installing from scratch. 

_This page provides a comprehensive list of all changes in the release._

## Upgrading to 0.1.6

See our guide on [upgrading Mathesar to 0.1.6](../administration/upgrade/0.1.6.md).

## Improvements

### You can now configure Mathesar's UI to display in Japanese

The language setting is stored per-user and can be modified when logging in or when editing a user. This changes the text displayed on buttons and other UI elements within Mathesar. It does not change the display of data within your database (e.g. table names, column names, and cell values). We are hoping to support more languages beyond English and Japanese eventually. Please reach out to us if your are interested in helping to add more translations!

### Text fields now auto-expands on the record page to accommodate longer texts

**Before**

All text inputs on the record page had the same height, regardless of their content.

### Mathesar is now compatible with Python versions: 3.10 and 3.11 along with 3.9

Mathesar now officially supports Python versions 3.10 and 3.11, in addition to the existing 3.9 compatibility. This will provide great flexibility while building Mathesar from source on an OS that natively ships with relatively newer versions of Python.
