# Mathesar 0.2.4

## Summary

This release contains targeted fixes for bugs within Mathesar's new [UNIX socket connection](./0.2.3.md#more-options-for-internal-database-connections) feature, as released in version 0.2.3.

We are keeping _this_ release intentionally narrow to expedite delivery of these bug fixes. Additional new features and improvements will launch in our 0.3.0 release, targeted for June 2025.

_This page provides a comprehensive list of all changes in the release._

### Unix socket bug fixes

In version 0.2.3, users experienced the following issues when connecting via Unix socket:

- Inability to create new databases when Mathesar's internal database used a Unix socket connection [#4473](https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar/pull/4473 "Hotfix for SQLAlchemy connecting to DBs over UNIX sockets").
- Failure to connect when the internal database used a Unix socket connection with an explicit port specified [#4473](https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar/pull/4473 "Fix issues related to connections via unix socket").
- Problems working with data explorations whose base tables were connected via Unix socket [#4481](https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar/pull/4481 "Fix issues related to connections via unix socket").

These issues have all been resolved. Additionally, Unix socket connections **no longer require URL encoding**. Instead, they must now be provided unencoded:

* ❌ `%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fpostgresql`
* ✅ `/var/run/postgresql`


## Upgrading to 0.2.4  {:#upgrading}
