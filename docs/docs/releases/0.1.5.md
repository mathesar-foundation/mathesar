### For installations using Docker Compose

If you have a Docker compose installation (including one from the guided script), run the command below:

```
docker compose -f /etc/mathesar/docker-compose.yml up --pull always -d
```

!!! warning "Your installation directory may be different"
    You may need to change `/etc/mathesar/` in the command above if you chose to install Mathesar to a different directory.


### For installations done from scratch

If you installed from scratch, the upgrade instructions are the same as [for 0.1.4](./0.1.4.md#upgrading), except that you'll need to specify version 0.1.5 when pulling code from the repository in Step 2. You should also skip Step 5 â€“ you do not need to change the environment variables.
