# Mathesar 0.2.3

???+ warning "Switch to 0.2.5 if connecting over Unix socket"
    If you plan to connect Postgres databases to Mathesar over a Unix socket, we _strongly_ recommend upgrading to version [0.2.5](./0.2.5.md). Unix socket connections were introduced in 0.2.3 but contained a number of bugs related to port specification and the creation of new databases.

## Summary

Mathesar 0.2.3 adds support for row duplication, enhanced paste behavior in newly saved rows, new ways to connect an internal database, and improved numeric inference.

	This page provides a comprehensive list of all changes in the release.

## Improvements
<!-- (Each feature within this section should have its own level-three heading) -->

### More options for internal database connections

Mathesar now supports connecting to internal PostgreSQL databases using any valid connection string, including configurations that:

- Use Unix sockets instead of TCP/IP.
- Omit the port or do not require a password.

Previously, Mathesar required both a port and password to be defined, which prevented these types of connections. This was a common pain point for users attempting to use custom Postgres installations.

Here's an example of the `docker-compose.yml` configuration to connect to Postgres running on the UNIX socket:

```yml
POSTGRES_HOST="%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fpostgresql"
POSTGRES_PORT=""
POSTGRES_USER="mathesar"
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=""
POSTGRES_DB="mathesar_django"
```

!!! tip "Tip"
    `%2F` is the URL-encoded version of `/`, which is required when specifying a Unix socket path in a PostgreSQL connection string.

[#4416](https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar/pull/4416 "Make password and port optional for django db connection string")

### "Duplicate row" functionality

It's now easy to duplicate rows in Mathesar using the "right click" context menu. Right click any cell in the row you would like to duplicate and choose "Duplicate Record".

[#4414](https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar/pull/4414 "Implement context menu to duplicate records")

### Support for pasting into cells of newly-inserted rows

You may now paste data into the cells of newly-saved rows. Previously, you needed to hit the "refresh" button or reload the page before pasting into these rows.

It is still not possible to paste into new, _unsaved_ rows. Attempting to do so will present an error:

![A screenshot of Mathesar's showing an error when pasting into an unsaved row](../assets/releases/0.2.3/row-error.png)

[#4410](https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar/pull/4410 "Support pasting into new PersistedRecordRow cells")

<!-- ## Groundwork -->
<!-- (Use this section to list any incremental work done on still-incomplete changes) -->

### Improved inference for numeric columns

In this release we have greatly improved the accuracy, safety, and performance of type inference for numeric columns. This means that Mathesar is much faster and reliable at detecting the type of numeric columns.

In the future, this will enable significant front end performance improvements when switching columns to and from numeric types.

## Maintenance

### Removed redundant casting functions

Many of Mathesar's existing casting functions included multiple versions that accepted different types of parameters. Where possible, we are making an effort to simplify and remove these redundant functions.
