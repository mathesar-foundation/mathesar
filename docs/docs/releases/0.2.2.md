# Mathesar 0.2.2

???+ note "Help shape the future of Mathesar"
    We're looking to speak with users to better understand how Mathesar can help you or your team. It's only a 20 minute interview, and we're happy to offer a $25 gift card in return.

    If you're interested in helping, you can use [this link](https://cal.com/mathesar/users) to schedule a chat with Zack on the Mathesar team. Thank you!

## Summary

Mathesar 0.2.2 brings key improvements, including enhanced primary key handling, smart pasting for easier data entry, and various bug fixes. Users can now choose UUIDs as primary keys, designate any existing column as a primary key during data import, and benefit from a new UUID column type.

_This page provides a comprehensive list of all changes in the release._

## Improvements

### Enhanced primary key handling

Mathesar 0.2.2 introduces several improvements to working with primary keys, including support for UUIDs as primary keys. We've also added a dedicated UUID column type, making it easier to work with UUIDs in any column—not just primary keys.

#### Improvements when importing data

When importing existing data, Mathesar automatically generates a primary key column if one isn’t provided. Previously, importing a simple CSV like:

```csv
First Name,Last Name
Jane,Park
Steve,Smith
Laura,Stein
Amy,Richards
```

would result in Mathesar automatically adding an integer primary key column that auto-increments by default.

That's still the default behavior. But now, you can choose the type of generated primary key column: either an auto-incrementing integer _or_ a UUID column with a default value of a random UUIDv4:

Additionally, you can now designate _any_ existing column as the primary key. If you select a UUID or Number column, you’ll have the option to apply the same default value settings that Mathesar uses for generated primary key columns.

#### Improvements to creating tables

When creating new tables in Mathesar, you'll now have the option to set the name and type of your primary key column:

As when importing data, you can choose between an auto-incrementing integer _or_ a UUID column with a default value of a random UUIDv4.

#### Improvements to tables without primary keys

Previously, Mathesar would display all kinds of errors when viewing and attempting to edit records in tables without primary keys. Now, we've made the limitations of working with tables without primary keys in Mathesar much clearer:

- Cell editing is disabled
- The placeholder row and 'Add new record' button is hidden.
- We display an attention indicator with a tooltip that mentions that row level operations are not supported.

### Smart pasting to and from cells

Mathesar now supports smart pasting, making it easy to update multiple cells across rows in one go. Mathesar automatically handles type conversions, so you can paste data from different formats without hassle. Linked column references work just like any other value.

After selecting and copying cells, highlight the cells to paste into and press your system's keyboard shortcut (`Command+V`/`⌘+V` on macOS, and `Ctrl+V` on Windows and Linux).

You'll see a conformation dialog:

After choosing "paste", your selected rows will be updated with the new values.
