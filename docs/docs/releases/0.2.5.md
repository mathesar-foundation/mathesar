## Summary

This release fixes a regression in connecting Databases to Mathesar's Data Explorer introduced by the [0.2.4](./0.2.4.md) release.

Additional new features and improvements will launch in our 0.3.0 release, targeted for June 2025.

_This page provides a comprehensive list of all changes in the release._

### Data explorer regression

Due to a typo in our code access to the Data Explorer was restricted to only support databases connected over Unix socket.
