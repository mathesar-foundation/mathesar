# Install Mathesar Webserver via Docker


## Prerequisites
!!! warning ""
    This installation procedure is intended for users who want to run a bare-bones version of the Mathesar web server. It is assumed you already have services like a reverse proxy needed for running a production server. To set up a proper production server, please refer to the [Docker Compose Installation Documentation](../docker-compose/index.md).

- You need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
    - We have tested with Docker v23. Older versions may not work.
- Permission to run Docker containers
- A Postgres database. Ensure the external database can accept network connections from your Mathesar server.
- Have the following information handy before installation:
    - Database hostname
    - Database port
    - Database name
    - Database username _(should exist and be a `SUPERUSER` [more info](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/sql-createrole.html))_
    - Database password

## Installation Steps

1. Run the Mathesar Docker Image

    ```bash
    docker run \
      --detach
      -e DJANGO_DATABASE_URL='<replace with a postgres connection string>' \
      -e MATHESAR_DATABASES='(<unique_db_key>|<replace with a postgres connection array>)' \
      -e SECRET_KEY='<replace with a 50 character string>' \
      -e ALLOWED_HOSTS='.localhost, 127.0.0.1, [::1]' \
      -v static:/code/static \
      -v media:/code/media \
      --name mathesar_service \
      -p 8000:8000 \
      --restart unless-stopped \
      mathesar/mathesar-prod:latest
    ```
    
    The above command creates a docker container containing the Mathesar server running on the `localhost` and listening on port `8000`. It also:

    - Passes configuration options as environment variables to the docker container. Refer to [Configuring Mathesar web server](../../configuration/env-variables.md#backend) for setting the correct value to these configuration options and for additional configuration options. The configuration options used in the above command are:
        - `DJANGO_DATABASE_URL`
        - `DJANGO_DATABASE_KEY`
        - `MATHESAR_DATABASES`
        - `SECRET_KEY`
    - Creates two [named docker volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/)
        - `static` for storing static assets like CSS, js files
        - `media` for storing user-uploaded media files
    - Sets the container name as `mathesar_service` using the `--name` parameter, runs the container in a detached mode using the `--detach` parameter, and binds the port `8000` to the `localhost`. Refer to [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#options) for additional configuration options.

1. Verify if the Mathesar Server is running successfully:
    ```bash
    docker logs -f mathesar_service
    ```

1. Create a superuser
    ```bash
    docker exec -it mathesar_service python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
    A prompt will appear to ask for the superuser details, fill in the details to create a superuser. At least one superuser is necessary for accessing Mathesar.

    See the Django docs for more information on the [`createsuperuser` command](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/django-admin/#createsuperuser)

## Upgrade

1. Stop your existing Mathesar container:

    ```bash
    docker stop mathesar_service
    ```

1. Remove the old Mathesar Image
    ```bash
    docker rm mathesar_service
    ```

1. Bump the image version in the `docker run` command you usually use to run your
   Mathesar and start up a brand-new container:

    ```bash
    docker run \
      -d \
      --name mathesar_service \
      # YOUR STANDARD ARGS HERE
      mathesar/mathesar-prod:latest
    ```

## Uninstall

1. Remove the Mathesar container.

    ```bash
    docker rm -v mathesar_service
    ```

2. Remove the Mathesar Image

    ```bash
    docker rmi mathesar_service
    ```

3. Remove volumes related to Mathesar

    ```bash
    docker volume rm static &&
    docker volume rm media
    ```

4. Remove Mathesar internal schemas.

    **If you connected Mathesar to a database**, the installation process would have created a new schema for Mathesar's use. You can remove this schema from that database as follows:

    1. Connect to the database.

        ```
        psql -h <DB HOSTNAME> -p <DB PORT> -U <DB_USER> <DB_NAME>
        ```

    2. Delete the schema.

        ```postgresql
        DROP SCHEMA mathesar_types CASCADE;
        ```

        !!! danger 
            Deleting this schema will also delete any database objects that depend on it. This should not be an issue if you don't have any data using Mathesar's custom data types.
