## Starting and stopping Mathesar {:#start-stop}

The Mathesar server needs to be running for you to use Mathesar. If you restart your machine, you'll need to start the server again.

- **Start** Mathesar:

    === "Linux"
        ```
        sudo docker compose -f /etc/mathesar/docker-compose.yml up -d
        ```

    === "MacOS"
        ```
        docker compose -f /etc/mathesar/docker-compose.yml up -d
        ```

- **Stop** Mathesar:

    === "Linux"
        ```
        sudo docker compose -f /etc/mathesar/docker-compose.yml down
        ```

    === "MacOS"
        ```
        docker compose -f /etc/mathesar/docker-compose.yml down
        ```

    This stops all Mathesar Docker containers and releases their ports.

!!! note
    If you customized the Mathesar configuration directory during installation, you'll need to change `/etc/mathesar` to your configuration directory.

## Upgrading Mathesar {:#upgrade}

!!! tip "Upgrade from within Mathesar"
    You can also run the upgrade from within Mathesar by logging in as an admin user and navigating to "Administration" (in the top right menu) > "Software Update"

Manually upgrade Mathesar to the newest version using Watchtower:

=== "Linux"
    ```
    sudo docker exec mathesar-watchtower-1 /watchtower --run-once
    ```

=== "MacOS"
    ```
    docker exec mathesar-watchtower-1 /watchtower --run-once
    ```

Manually upgrade Mathesar to the newest version without using Watchtower:

=== "Linux"
    ```
    sudo docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --force-recreate --build service
    ```

=== "MacOS"
    ```
    docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --force-recreate --build service
    ```

## Uninstalling Mathesar {:#uninstall}

1. Remove all Mathesar Docker images and containers.

    === "Linux"
        ```
        sudo docker compose -f /etc/mathesar/docker-compose.yml down --rmi all -v
        ```

    === "MacOS"
        ```
        docker compose -f /etc/mathesar/docker-compose.yml down --rmi all -v
        ```

1. Remove configuration files.

    ```sh
    sudo rm -rf /etc/mathesar
    ```

    !!! note
        If you customized the Mathesar configuration directory during installation, you'll need to change `/etc/mathesar` to your configuration directory.
