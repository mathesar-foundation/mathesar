Mathesar [metadata](/user-guide/metadata/) and [data explorations](/user-guide/data-explorer/) are currently readable and writable by all collaborators on a database, regardless of their PostgreSQL role's permissions or their [user's admin status](/user-guide/users/#admin). If you need to restrict access to metadata or data explorations, we would be curious to hear about your use case and welcome you to [open an issue](https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar/issues) to discuss it.
