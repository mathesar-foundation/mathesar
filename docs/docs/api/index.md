# Mathesar's API

Mathesar has an API available at `/api/rpc/v0/` which follows the [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) spec version 2.0. It has been built primarily for consumption by the Mathesar front end but theoretically could be used to build automation workflows and Mathesar integrations.

## Caveats

- The Mathesar API is **not yet stable**. If you build logic that depends on it, be mindful that future Mathesar versions will likely bring breaking changes to the API without warning or notice.

- This API _documentation_ is still in its early stages and may contain inaccuracies or incomplete information. If you encounter any issues, please [report](https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar/issues) them via GitHub.

- A small subset of functionality in Mathesar still relies on a legacy REST API which is gradually being phased out. It is not documented here.

## Usage

You can find a full list of Mathesar's RPC methods on the [API Methods page](./methods.md).

> [!TIP]
>    The methods are shown as Python function definitions to make them easier to understand, but they need to be converted into JSON payloads for API calls.
>
>    Here's how to convert a function call like this: `tables.list_(*, database_id=None, **kwargs)` into an API payload.
>
>    1. The function name becomes the method path:
>        - `tables.list_` converts to `"method": "tables.list"`
>    2. Named parameters become part of the `"parameters"` object:
>       ```json
>       {
>         "method": "tables.list",
>         "parameters": {
>         "database_id": 1
>         }
>       }
>       ```

### Requests

To use an RPC method:

- Call it with a dot path starting from its root path.
- Always use named parameters.
- Ensure that your request includes HTTP headers for valid session IDs, as well as CSRF cookies and tokens.

> [!NOTE]
>    To list information about tables for a schema, call the [`tables.list`](./methods/#tables.list_) method with a payload like this:
>
>    `POST /api/rpc/v0/`
>
>    ```json
>    {
>      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
>      "id": 234,
>      "method": "tables.list",
>      "params": {
>        "schema_oid": 47324,
>        "database_id": 1
>      }
>    }
>    ```

### Success Responses

Upon a successful RPC method call, the API will return a success object with the following form:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 234,
  "result": <any>
}
```

The `result` is whatever was returned by the underlying method.

### Error Responses

When an RPC method call fails, it generates an error response of the following form:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 234,
  "error": {
    "code": <int>,
    "message": <str>
  }
}
```

The `code` is a negative integer. Some codes are produced according to the [JSON-RPC spec](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#error_object).

Other error codes are grouped according to the library that produced the Exception:

- `builtins`: -31xxx
- `psycopg` or `psycopg2`: -30xxx
- `django`: -29xxx
- `mathesar` (our code): -28xxx
- `db` (our code): -27xxx
- `sqlalchemy`: -26xxx
- other: -25xxx

Unrecognized errors from a given library return a "round number" code, so an unknown `builtins` error gets the code -31000.
